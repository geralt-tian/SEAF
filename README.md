# SEAF: Secure Evaluation on Activation Functions with Dynamic Precision for
Secure Two-Party Inference
## Setup
For setup instructions, please refer to each of the components' readme.

Alternatively you can use the **setup_env_and_build.sh** script. It installs dependencies and builds each component. It also creates a virtual environment in a *mpc_venv* folder with all the required packages. If you want to do setup with default paths and settings do ``./setup_env_and_build.sh quick``, otherwise if you want to manually choose paths you can use ``./setup_env_and_build.sh``.

Please do ``source mpc_venv/bin/activate`` before using the toolchain.
